# Using a Character in a Song

There are two ways to use your character in a song once it's implemented.

1. Create a new chart. Open the Chart Editor, start a chart, and select the character from the `Metadata` toolbox before charting.
2. Edit an existing chart in your mod. Open the `metadata.json` file and check in `playData.characters` for the `player`, `girlfriend`, and `opponent` keys.

Once the chart which references your character is in your mod folder, simply start the game with your mod installed.
