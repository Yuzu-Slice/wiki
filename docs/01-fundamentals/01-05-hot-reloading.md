# Hot Reloading

While developing your mod, you may find it inconvenient to make a change, open the game, encounter an error or visual issue, have to close the game, make another change, then open the game again and start the process over and over in order to achieve the desired results for your custom content.

Thankfully, there is a better way! **Press F5 to force the game to dump its cache and reload all game data from disk,** then restart the current state with the appropriate changes applied. This lets you, for example:

- Tweak the positions of stage props, or add new ones, then immediately reload to see them in game.
- Modify the animation offsets for a character and quickly ensure they work.
- Modify a script to resolve an exception and reload to continue testing without closing the game.
