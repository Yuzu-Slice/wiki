# Using a Note Style in a Song

There are currently two ways to use your note style in a song once it's implemented.

1. Create a new chart. Open the Chart Editor, start a chart, and then select the `Notestyle` box from the `Metadata` toolbox before charting.
2. Edit an existing chart in your mod. Open the `metadata.json` file of the song you want to modify and check in `playData` for the `noteStyle` key.

Once the chart which references your note style is in your mod folder, simply start the game with your mod installed.
