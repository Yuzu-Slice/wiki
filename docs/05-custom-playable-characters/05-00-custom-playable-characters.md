# Creating a Friday Night Funkin' Mod - Custom Playable Characters

This chapter will walk you through the process of creating a functioning, fully compatible Friday Night Funkin' mod, using the game's official systems for loading custom content and scripts. Once your mod is complete, you will be able to place it in the `mods` folder in your game install and use its content in-game without overriding the base game content and still maintain compatibility with other mods.

This chapter goes over adding new playable characters to the game, ensuring that they appear in the Character Select menu, determining whether the character has been unlocked, customizing the appearance of the Freeplay menu, and adding custom remixes to them.
