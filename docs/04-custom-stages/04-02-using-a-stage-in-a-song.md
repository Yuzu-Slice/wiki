# Using a Stage in a Song

There are two ways to use your stage in a song once it's implemented.

1. Create a new chart. Open the Chart Editor, start a chart, and select the stage from the `Metadata` toolbox before charting.
2. Edit an existing chart in your mod. Open the `metadata.json` file and check in `playData` for the `stage` key, and set it to your internal ID.

Once the chart which references your stage is in your mod folder, simply start the game with your mod installed.
